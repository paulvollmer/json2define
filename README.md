# json2define

Parse a json file and create for each item a `#define itemX "variableY"` line.  
This can be useful if you want to include some json data into a c or c++ application.

**At the moment this tool is in development!**


## TODO

- if an "-" is used at a json item, replace with "_"
- arrays names not set to define names
- opensource it to github
- create gh-page
- web frontend
- release to npm
